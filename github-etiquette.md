####### Sample GitHub rules

- 1 Keep file paths short and sensible.
- 2 Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names, 
...these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
- 3 Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - 
...you wouldn't want anyone's work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
